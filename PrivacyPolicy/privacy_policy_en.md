## What data we collect

Here an example of stored device information collected by Crashlytics:

- An RFC-4122 UUID which permits us to deduplicate crashes
- The timestamp of when the crash occurred
- The app's bundle identifier and full version number
- The device's operating system name and version number
- A boolean indicating whether the device was jailbroken/rooted
- The device's model name, CPU architecture, amount of RAM and disk space
