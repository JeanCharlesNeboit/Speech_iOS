This is how the Speech application was born. It was quickly found to be useful for other people suffering from pathologies that prevent them from communicating (facial paralysis, speech disorders, etc.) and this, all over the world. Thus, Speech, beyond its origin, wants to give people deprived of speech a way to express themselves.";
