The ADOL43 association (Haute-Loire), a departmental association for the fight against pain, wanted to offer laryngectomized patients at the Emile Roux hospital (Le Puy-en-Velay) a mobile application so that they could continue to communicate with their environment. This is how the Speech application was born. It was quickly found to be useful for other people suffering from pathologies that prevent them from communicating (facial paralysis, speech disorders, etc.) and this, all over the world. Thus, Speech, beyond its origin, is today an application whose goal is to give people deprived of speech a way to express themselves.";
